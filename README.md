# Ooh for goodness sake, GRO-Up

Hate GROMACS' convoluted simulation setup process? This is a simple bash program to generate topology, box + solvate, add ions, minimise energy and equilibriate with nvt + npt. 

To use, dump all the PDBs you want to prepare into `/PDBs`, run `setup.sh` in `/scripts` and see output in `/results`
